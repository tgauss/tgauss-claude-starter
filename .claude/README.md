## Workflow Overview

### Scout → Plan → Build

This project uses a three-phase workflow:

1. **🔍 Scout** - Research and understand the codebase
   - Output: `.claude/scout/NNN-scout-description.md`
   - Command: `/scout` or `/auto_scout_plan_build`

2. **📋 Plan** - Create detailed implementation plan
   - Output: `.claude/plans/NNN-description.md`
   - Command: `/plan` or `/auto_scout_plan_build`

3. **🔨 Build** - Execute the plan with quality checks
   - Updates: Plan file with ✅ checkmarks
   - Command: `/build` or `/auto_scout_plan_build`

- Track progress with checkboxes
- Link to corresponding scout reports
- Updated during build phase

See [plans/README.md](plans/README.md) for details.

### 📁 scout/

Scout reports from research phase:

- Numbered sequentially (001, 002, 003...)
- Document existing code and patterns
- Provide recommendations
- Feed into implementation plans

See [scout/README.md](scout/README.md) for details.

## Quick Start

### Running a Full Workflow

**Fastest (Recommended):**

```bash
/auto_scout_plan_build [Your objective description]
# Example: /auto_scout_plan_build Add dark mode toggle to settings
```

- Autonomous scout + plan phases
- Single approval gate before build
- Most efficient for well-defined tasks

**Traditional (More Control):**

```bash
/scout_plan_build [Your objective description]
# Approval at each phase: scout → approval → plan → approval → build
```

**Manual (Maximum Control):**

```bash
/scout              # Research first, creates scout report
/plan               # Review scout report, create plan
/build              # Review plan, execute implementation
```

### Code Review & Quality

```bash
/review              # Comprehensive code review (Pragmatic Quality framework)
/security-review     # Security-focused review of pending changes
```

### Managing External Documentation

```bash
/fetch-docs [package]    # Fetch docs for specific package (e.g., react, vite)
/update-docs             # Check for updates based on package.json changes
/track-docs [package]    # Add new package to documentation tracking
```

External documentation is automatically checked by **knowledge-maintainer** agent after builds.
See [knowledge/external-docs-management.md](knowledge/external-docs-management.md) for details.

### Brainstorming & Planning

```bash
/brainstorm [Topic or feature to explore]
# Interactive session for exploring ideas and architectural approaches
```

### Creating Custom Commands

```bash
/meta_command [Description of what the command should do]
# Example: /meta_command Create a command that runs tests and generates coverage
```

### Git Operations

The **git-wizard** agent is automatically invoked for:

- Creating branches (follows naming convention: TICKET-NUMBER-description)
- Making commits (conventional commits, co-authored by Claude)
- Creating pull requests (auto-generates PR description)
- Rebasing and branch management

## File Versioning

All commands and agents follow semantic versioning:

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
```

Update versions when making breaking changes to command interfaces.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Workflow

| Command                       | Use When                                        | Approval Gates              | Speed             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `/auto_scout_plan_build`      | Well-defined task, trust Claude to scout & plan | 1 (before build)            | ⚡️⚡️⚡️ Fastest |
| `/scout_plan_build`           | Want to review scout findings before planning   | 2 (after scout, after plan) | ⚡️⚡️ Medium     |
| `/scout` → `/plan` → `/build` | Maximum control, complex/uncertain tasks        | 3 (manual at each step)     | ⚡️ Slowest       |

### Knowledge Base Guidelines

✅ **Do:**

- Reference knowledge files **before** creating new utilities (avoid duplication)
- Update knowledge files when adding new patterns or utilities
- Create knowledge files for frequently-worked feature areas
- Keep knowledge files current as features evolve

❌ **Don't:**

- Skip checking knowledge base (leads to duplicate utilities)
- Let knowledge files become stale
- Create knowledge files for one-off features

### Workflow Report Guidelines

**Scout Reports** answer:

- "What exists and how does it work?"
- "What patterns are already in place?"
- "What dependencies and integrations exist?"

**Implementation Plans** answer:

- "How should we implement this?"
- "What steps are required?"
- "What are the risks and mitigations?"

**Keep reports updated** as implementation evolves (living documents)

## Configuration

### Command Frontmatter

All commands use standardized frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of what this command does
category: workflow | meta | code-review
version: 1.0.0
allowed-tools: Task, Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
argument-hint: [description of arguments]
model: sonnet | opus | haiku
---
```

### Permissions

Tool permissions are configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

- **Allowed Tools** - Which tools Claude can access
- **Auto-Approved Commands** - Commands that run without approval
- **Team Settings** - Shared with repository (`.claude/settings.json`)
- **Personal Settings** - Git-ignored (`.claude/settings.local.json`)

See [PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md) for detailed configuration guide.

## Agents Overview

Claude Code uses specialized sub-agents for complex tasks:

| Agent                    | Purpose                                  | When Used                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **agent-architect**      | Design and build new AI agents           | When designing agents (Ruby Scaffold method) |
| **code-reviewer**        | Elite code review, security, performance | Proactively after significant code changes   |
| **doc-fetcher**          | Fetch external documentation             | `/fetch-docs`, `/update-docs`, `/track-docs` |
| **git-wizard**           | Git operations (commits, PRs, branches)  | Automatically for all git workflows          |
| **knowledge-maintainer** | Updates knowledge base after builds      | Proactively after `/build` completes         |
| **meta_agent**           | Creates new sub-agent configs            | `/meta_agent` or when creating agents        |

**Proactive agents** (automatically invoked):

- `code-reviewer` - After writing significant code
- `knowledge-maintainer` - After build phase completes
- `git-wizard` - For all git operations (commits, PRs, branches)

## Security Features

The `.claude/hooks/` directory contains security scripts that protect:

- **Git operations** - Prevents destructive commands (force push to main, hard reset)
- **Credentials** - Blocks reading API keys, tokens, passwords
- **Sensitive files** - Protects critical files from accidental modification
- **Bash commands** - Validates commands before execution

All hooks run automatically when Claude Code executes operations.
See [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md) and [hooks/SECURITY-OVERVIEW.md](hooks/SECURITY-OVERVIEW.md).

## Auto-Maintenance System

The project self-maintains as you work:

- **PostToolUse hooks** track file changes and detect commits/builds
- **`[maintenance-hint]` signals** prompt Claude to update knowledge and clean artifacts
- **Stop hook** flags pending maintenance for the next session
- **CLAUDE.md instructions** tell Claude when to invoke the knowledge-maintainer agent

Maintenance is invisible — Claude handles cleanup, knowledge updates, and artifact rotation automatically between tasks. See the Self-Maintenance section in [CLAUDE.md](/CLAUDE.md).

## Common Workflows

### 1. Feature Development

```bash
/auto_scout_plan_build Implement user authentication system
# Scout → Plan → Approve → Build
# Auto-invokes: git-wizard (branch), code-reviewer (review), knowledge-maintainer (docs)
```

### 2. Bug Fix

```bash
/scout_plan_build Fix login redirect issue
# More control with approval after scout phase
```

### 3. Code Review

```bash
/review               # Before committing
/security-review      # Before deploying
```

### 4. Documentation Update

```bash
/update-docs          # Check for package updates
/fetch-docs react     # Fetch specific package docs
```

### 5. Brainstorming Architecture

```bash
/brainstorm State management approach for multi-tenant theming
```

## Contributing

When adding new commands or agents:

1. **Follow naming conventions**
   - Commands: `kebab-case.md`
   - Agents: `kebab-case.md`
   - Plans/Scouts: `NNN-description.md` (3-digit sequential)

2. **Include proper frontmatter**
